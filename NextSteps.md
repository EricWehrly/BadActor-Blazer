Player objective to define infected machine groups (for grouping...)
 
 virus complexity (dictates write time, patch time)

working against player to shut down distributor sites

music sharer app (acts as a viral distributor, but can be boosted by player running on workers)

Icons in viral distributor need to light up according to distributed viruses.

Starting an app into a group only starts it on all machines currently in the group
	Newly added machines won’t be running it

Virus compounding (ability to distribute new viruses to machines you've already infected)

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Objective progress tracking
	(instead of showing '10 workers' with checkbox, show '3 / 10 workers', etc.)

Objectives:
	Grow to 100 nodes
	Get facebook user list from marketing syndication partner
	Grow to 100,000 nodes
	DDoS Ashley Madison
	DDoS candidate campaign site

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Research

Research for obfuscation (levels):
	Makes your running applications harder to detect,
	Can now hack machines with a higher security level

Some kind of research for getting past stronger security?

Research unlocks new 
OS and app specific exploit finder apps 

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Exploits and mechanisms each have their own properties for how discoverable they are, etc 

You can spend time looking for new exploits, or researching into delivery mechanisms (some can be unlocked, some can be advanced) 

You can set slave machines to researching exploits 

Maybe exploits are found by running the app (Webserver, for instance) and the exploit finder app, which will scan all running apps ...

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Computer ram property dictates how many app slots. 
	Localhost starts with 2, early slaves with 1
	App slots need to become drop targets

Purchase PC upgrades for more CPU, more RAM

Marketing / ads for malicious website distributors?
	Maybe some other way of driving traffic ... ?

Mailing lists,
	Which are purchased from the black market,
	and used in conjunction with spam bot application
	to act as viral distributor
Has three properties: Seller, Price, and user quality
	(quality meant to represent income vs ineptitude, but just stick it to a machine quality)

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Items being removed from lists (Viruses, machines, etc.) should fade out instead of just disappear immediately

Should vulnerability be tied to access level?
	If we’re doing it like Plague Inc, 
		maybe different vectors could have different levels of “vulnerability” (ability to break in),
		and “access level”
	But it’s exploiting that access level that can get you kicked off the machine

Research for ‘vulnerability chain’. 
	After the first vulnerability has been put on a machine, 
	a second one can increase the amount of machine taken over

News ticker app reveals your notoriety 
	(indication of how hard people are working to take you down) 
	Can be upgraded to be more parsible / terse 
	(instead of showing random news blips, evolves up to being a color coded danger level) 

Application / research attribute for your "fingerprints" dictates how easy it is to trace back to you 

--------------------- Then ---------------------

Cookie jar deployable watches for idle unlocked machines in office buildings 
"who hacked the mainframe with the cookie jar" 

--------------------- Alternative Approaches ---------------------

It's possible to run across exploits from around the web, accidentally. These are like chance items that add the exploits to your inventory 

You can also be gifted exploits, which are very risky to run
